Description: # Cobble Bindings for Python
        
        Could be implemented in 2 ways:
        
        * CDLL
        * Extension Module
        
        For now we will use CDLL
        
        
        ## macOS
        
        On macOS, a event loop (NSRunLoop) is required for interating with CoreBluetooth - work must not be done on the main thread.
